<h2 align="left">WHAT IS ECOSYSTEM?</h2>
<hr/>
<p>An ecosystem (or ecological system) is a system that environments and their organisms form through their interaction. Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, parent material which forms the soil and topography, control the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Internal factors are controlled, for example, by decomposition, root competition, shading, disturbance, succession, and the types of species present. While the resource inputs are generally controlled by external processes, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors. Therefore, internal factors not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Ecosystems are dynamic entities—they are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process of recovering from some past disturbance. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its resistance. The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience.</p>

<hr/>
<p>Ecosystems can be studied through a variety of approaches—theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation. Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems. Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy. Biotic factors of the ecosystem are living things; such as plants, animals, and bacteria, while abiotic are non-living components; such as water, soil and atmosphere.<p>

<h3 align="center">TYPES OF ECOSYSTEM</h3>
<p>An ecosystem can be as small as an oasis in a desert, or as big as an ocean, spanning thousands of miles. 
There are two types of ecosystem:<p>
<ul type>= square>
<li>Terrestrial Ecosystem</li>
<li>Aquatic Ecosystem</li>
<hr/>
<h4 align="left">Terrestrial Ecosystem</h4>
<p>Terrestrial ecosystems are exclusively land-based ecosystems. There are different types of terrestrial ecosystems distributed around various geological zones. 
They are as follows:<p>
<li>Forest Ecosystem</li>
<li>Grassland Ecosystem</li>
<li>Tundra Ecosystem</li>
<li>Desert Ecosystem</li>
